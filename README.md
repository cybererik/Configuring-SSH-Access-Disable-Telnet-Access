Lab Topology: Use any single router or switch to complete this lab and one computer.


Lab Objective: The objective of this lab exercise is to learn and understand how to configure a router or switch for SSH access. The router or switch IOS must support encryption in order for the commands to work.


Lab Purpose: Protecting Cisco devices by disabling Telnet and enabling SSH-only access is a core security step. SSH is a secure protocol that uses encryption to protect data transmitted between a client and a server.
